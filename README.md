# 01 Exercise - Fetch GIFs from Giphy

## Brief

Use the Giphy API to display a GIF on the page when a button is clicked.

You will read the Giphy API documentation, to get an understanding of what URLs you can use to do certain tasks. Then use the Fetch API to make requests to the Giphy API, to get the details of an image. Finally, you will use the image information to append an image to your HTML web page.

## Rationale

When building web applications, it's very common to fetch data from APIs. Being able to call APIs in JavaScript enables you to build sophisticated web applications that can run in the browser.
